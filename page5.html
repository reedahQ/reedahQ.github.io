    <dd>Summary:
        The Terminator is a classic sci-fi action film directed by James Cameron. The story centers around a futuristic war between humans and machines. In 2029, an artificial intelligence system called Skynet sends a cyborg assassin, known as the Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Sarah’s future son, John Connor, will eventually lead the human resistance against the machines, so eliminating her prevents his birth. In response, the human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back in time to protect Sarah. The movie explores the high-stakes chase between the nearly indestructible Terminator and the vulnerable but determined Sarah and Kyle.
        <br> Review:
        The Terminator is a groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, blending high-octane action with thought-provoking themes about fate, technology, and survival. Schwarzenegger’s portrayal of the relentless, emotionless cyborg is iconic, and the film’s mix of practical effects and thrilling chase sequences make it a tense and engaging experience. It’s a lean, well-executed sci-fi action movie that also touches on deeper ideas about how technology could go wrong. The blend of suspense, action, and clever storytelling makes The Terminator one of the defining films of the genre.</dd>
